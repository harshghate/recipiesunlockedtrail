        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <h4>Prepareation</h4>
        <p>1 -> Pick the poha first. Rinse them in clean running water in a strainer or colander.
            <br>2 -> Make sure that you do not rinse it too much or else it breaks and gets mushy. While rinsing, the poha flakes absorb enough water and they become soft.
            <br>3 -> The poha flakes must become soft but remain intact, whole and separate. If they do not become soft, sprinkle few drops of water on them in the strainer till they get softened.
            <br>4 -> Put Oil in pan or any cooking utensil and Roast Peanuts until they become red.
            <br>5 -> Add Mustard seeds to the oil roast them until they start poping.
            <br>6 -> Add small pieces of Chilli to the pan and fry them until they get white spots.
            <br>7 -> Add sliced onion to the pan and fry them until they become red.
            <br>8 -> Add poha to the pan and add turmeric and salt and mix the mixture well.
            <br>9 -> Place lid on the pan and let it cook for 3-4 mins.
            <br>10 -> Garnish with coriander leaves or any type of sev and serve hot.
